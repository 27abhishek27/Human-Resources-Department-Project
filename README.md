## 📊 Dataset

The dataset, `Human_Resources.csv`, includes employee information with features such as:

- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Age**: Employee's age.
- **Department**: Department in which the employee works.
- **Education**: Level of education attained.
- **Job Role**: Specific role or position of the employee.
- **Marital Status**: Marital status of the employee.
- **Years at Company**: Tenure of the employee within the company.
- **Job Satisfaction**: Self-reported job satisfaction level.
- **Performance Rating**: Performance evaluation score.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/27abhishek27/Human-Resources-Department-Project.git
cd Human-Resources-Department-Project
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies:

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed any missing data in the dataset.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical features such as `Department`, `Education`, and `Job Role` into numerical representations.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Visualized distributions** of key features to understand data patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between different features to identify potential predictors of employee satisfaction and performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Investigated trends across departments, job roles, and other categorical variables.

### 3. **Model Building**

- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed machine learning models to predict employee performance ratings based on available features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
